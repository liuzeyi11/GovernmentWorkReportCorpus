<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>II. Major Tasks for 2008</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>今年是全面贯彻党的十七大精神的第一年，</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>This is the first year for comprehensively implementing the guiding principles set out at the Seventeenth CPC National Congress.</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>改革发展任务繁重而艰巨，做好政府工作意义重大。</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>We face arduous tasks in reform and development, and it is very important for us to successfully carry out the work of the government.</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>政府工作的基本思路和主要任务是：</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>The basic guidelines and major tasks for the government's work are as follows:</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>高举中国特色社会主义伟大旗帜，以邓小平理论和“三个代表”重要思想为指导，深入贯彻落实科学发展观，更加重视加强和改善宏观调控，更加重视推进改革开放和自主创新，更加重视调整经济结构和提高发展质量，更加重视节约资源和保护环境，更加重视改善民生和促进社会和谐，推进社会主义经济建设、政治建设、文化建设、社会建设，加快全面建设小康社会进程。</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>we must hold high the great banner of socialism with Chinese characteristics; take Deng Xiaoping Theory and the important thought of Three Represents as our guide; fully apply the Scientific Outlook on Development; attach greater importance to improving macroeconomic regulation, promoting reform, opening up and independent innovation, adjusting the economic structure and improving the quality of development, conserving resources and protecting the environment, and improving people's lives and promoting social harmony; promote socialist economic, political, cultural and social development; and accelerate the process of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects.</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>今年国民经济和社会发展的预期目标是：</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>We have set the following targets for economic and social development in 2008:</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>在优化结构、提高效益、降低消耗、保护环境的基础上，国内生产总值增长8%左右；居民消费价格总水平涨幅控制在4.8%左右；</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>on the basis of improving the economic structure, productivity, energy efficiency and environmental protection, the GDP should grow by about 8%, and the rise in the CPI should be held at around 4.8%.</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>城镇新增就业1000万人，城镇登记失业率控制在4.5%左右；</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Ten million jobs should be created in urban areas, and the rate of registered urban unemployment should be kept at around 4.5%. </seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>国际收支状况有所改善。</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Some improvement should be made in the balance of payments.</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>这里要着重说明，提出国内生产总值增长8%左右，主要是综合考虑了国内和国际多种因素，</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>It is important to note here that in setting the GDP growth target at around 8% for 2008, we have taken into account a variety of domestic and international factors.</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>着眼于保持经济平稳较快发展，引导各方面把主要精力和工作重点放在转变发展方式、深化改革、加快社会建设上，</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Our goal is to maintain both steady and fast economic growth, and guide all sectors of society to concentrate on changing the pattern of development, deepening reform and accelerating social development. </seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>防止片面追求和盲目攀比经济增长速度，</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>The different regions should not just seek faster growth or compete with each other to have the highest growth rate. </seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>实现经济社会又好又快发展。</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>We should promote both sound and fast economic and social development. </seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>提出居民消费价格总水平涨幅控制在4.8%左右，主要是由于去年价格上涨对今年价格的翘尾影响较大，推动价格上涨的因素较多，控制物价上涨的难度加大；</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>The major considerations in setting the target for keeping the CPI this year at around 4.8% are as follows: last year's price increases are still exerting a fairly strong influence and quite a few factors are creating inflationary pressure, making it difficult to bring price increases under control.</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>同时，又要考虑到居民、企业和社会各方面承受能力，努力避免物价涨幅过大。</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>At the same time, we have to take into consideration the ability of individuals, enterprises and all sectors of society to tolerate price increases and try our best to avoid sharp price increases.</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>实现经济社会发展的目标和任务，需要把握以下原则：</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>To attain the targets and accomplish the tasks for this year's economic and social development, we must adhere to the following principles:</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>坚持稳中求进，促进经济平稳较快发展；</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>we must make progress while maintaining stability and aim for fast yet steady economic development.</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>坚持好字优先，加快转变经济发展方式；</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>We must give priority to the quality rather than speed of development and accelerate improvement in the pattern of economic development. </seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>坚持改革开放，注重推进制度建设和创新；</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>We must pursue reform and opening up and attach great importance to promoting institutional improvements and innovations. </seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>坚持以人为本，加快以改善民生为重点的社会建设。</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>We must put people first and accelerate social development, with the focus on improving people's lives. </seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>今年经济工作，要把防止经济增长由偏快转为过热、防止价格由结构性上涨演变为明显通货膨胀作为宏观调控的首要任务；</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>The primary task for macroeconomic regulation this year is to prevent fast economic growth from becoming overheated growth and keep structural price increases from turning into significant inflation.</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>鉴于当前国内外经济形势发展的不确定因素较多，要密切跟踪分析新情况新问题，审时度势，从实际出发，及时灵活地采取相应对策，</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>There are quite a few uncertainties in the current economic situation at home and abroad, so we need to keep close track of new developments and problems, properly size up situations and take prompt and flexible measures to respond to them while keeping our feet firmly rooted in reality. </seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>正确把握宏观调控的节奏、重点和力度，保持经济平稳较快发展，避免出现大的起落。</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>We need to maintain the appropriate pace, focus and intensity of macroeconomic regulation to sustain steady and fast economic development and avoid drastic fluctuations in the economy.</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>今年要着重抓好以下九个方面工作：</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>We need to concentrate on the following nine tasks this year:</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>（一）搞好宏观调控，保持经济平稳较快发展</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>1. Improving macroeconomic regulation to maintain fast yet steady economic development.</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>根据国内外经济形势和宏观调控任务的要求，今年要实行稳健的财政政策和从紧的货币政策。</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>In view of the current domestic and international economic situation we need to follow a prudent fiscal policy and a tight monetary policy this year to accomplish the tasks for macroeconomic regulation.</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>继续实行稳健的财政政策，就是要保持财政政策的连续性和稳定性，充分发挥财政促进结构调整和协调发展的重要作用，增加对薄弱环节、改善民生、深化改革等方面的支出；</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Continuing to follow a prudent fiscal policy means that we must ensure the continuity and consistency of fiscal policy, get public finance to fully play its important role in promoting structural adjustment and balanced development, and increase expenditures to shore up weak links, improve people's lives and deepen reform.</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>同时，进一步减少财政赤字和长期建设国债。</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>In addition, we need to further reduce the budget deficit and the volume of long-term development treasury bonds. </seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>今年，中央财政赤字预算拟安排1800亿元，比去年预算赤字减少650亿元；</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>The deficit for the central government budget this year is set at 180 billion yuan, 65 billion yuan less than last year.</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>拟安排国债投资300亿元，比去年减少200亿元；增加中央预算内经常性建设投资，中央建设投资总计为1521亿元。</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>We plan to issue 30 billion yuan of treasury bonds for investment, 20 billion yuan less than last year, and increase allocations from the central government budget for general development, bringing total central government investment in development projects up to 152.1 billion yuan. </seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>继续调整财政支出和政府投资结构，较大幅度地增加“三农”、社会保障、医疗卫生、教育、文化、节能减排和廉租住房建设等方面支出。</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>We will continue to adjust the structure of government spending and investment by greatly increasing spending on agriculture, rural areas and farmers, the social safety net, medical and health care, education, culture, energy conservation and emissions reduction, and construction of low-rent housing. </seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>要抓好增收节支，依法加强税收征管，规范非税收入管理，控制一般性支出。</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>We will work hard to increase revenue and reduce expenditures, tighten tax collection and management in accordance with the law, improve management of non-tax revenue, and control regular expenditures. </seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>改革政府投资管理方式，提高投资使用效益。</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>We need to reform the management of government investment to improve the performance of investments.</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>合理安排财政超收收入。</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Government revenue surplus must be used wisely. </seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>去年全国财政比年度预算超收7239亿元，其中中央财政超收4168亿元。</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Total government revenue exceeded the targeted figure by more than 723.9 billion yuan last year, including 416.8 billion yuan in the central government budget. </seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>超预算收入使用的原则是：集中财力办关系民生和制度性建设方面的事，调整结构，加强薄弱环节。</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Surplus revenue should be concentrated on solving problems that have a direct bearing on people's lives, making institutional and structural improvements and strengthening weak links. </seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>依法增加地方两税返还和一般性转移支付的支出；增加农林水、教育、文化和科技方面支出；增加社会保障、医疗卫生、司法保障和廉租住房建设支出；增加节能减排和环境保护支出；解决农村义务教育债务和国有粮食企业财务挂账等历史遗留问题支出。</seg></tuv>

<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>In addition, the budget deficit should be reduced by 45 billion yuan and the central budget stability and regulation fund should be increased by 103.2 billion yuan.</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>实行从紧的货币政策，主要是考虑当前固定资产投资反弹压力较大，货币信贷投放仍然偏多，流动性过剩矛盾尚未缓解，价格上涨压力明显，需要加强金融调控，控制货币供应量和信贷过快增长。</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>The decision to follow a tight monetary policy was based on the following considerations: the strong possibility of a resurgence in fixed asset investment, continued excessive supplies of money and credit, the still-unsolved problem of excess liquidity, and considerable inflationary pressure. For these reasons, we must improve financial regulation to control the excessively rapid growth in the supplies of money and credit. </seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>一要综合运用公开市场操作、存款准备金率等方式，加大对冲流动性力度；</seg></tuv>

<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Second, with the focus on improving the credit structure, we will strictly follow requirements for granting loans and guarantee some loans while restricting others. </seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>控制中长期贷款增长，特别是对高耗能、高排放企业和产能过剩行业的贷款；</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>We will limit the increase in long- and medium-term loans, particularly to enterprises that are energy intensive or highly polluting and enterprises in industries with excess production capacity.</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>创新和改进银行信贷服务，完善担保、贴息等制度，加大对“三农”、服务业、中小企业、自主创新、节能环保、区域协调发展等方面的贷款支持。</seg></tuv>

<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>拓展外汇储备使用渠道和方式。</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>We will develop new channels and means for using foreign exchange reserves. </seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>同时，采取综合措施，努力改善国际收支状况。</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Comprehensive measures will be adopted to improve the balance of payments.</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>防止价格总水平过快上涨，是今年宏观调控的重大任务。</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>One major task for macroeconomic regulation this year is to prevent the overall price level from rising rapidly. </seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>必须从增加有效供给和抑制不合理需求两方面采取有力措施。</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>To fulfill this task, we must take powerful measures to increase effective supply while curbing excessive demand. </seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>一要大力发展生产，特别要加强粮食、食用植物油、肉类等基本生活必需品和其他紧缺商品生产，</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>First, we must expand production, especially the production of the basic necessities of life such as grain, vegetable oil and meat as well as other commodities in short supply.</seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>认真落实支持发展生产的政策措施，搞好产运销衔接。</seg></tuv>

<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>The reckless expansion of the capacity for intensive corn processing and construction work on such projects that violate regulations must be stopped. </seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>三要加快健全储备体系，改进和完善储备调节和进出口调节方式，适当增加国内紧缺重要消费品进口。</seg></tuv>

</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>六要加强市场和价格监管，抓好教育收费、医药价格、农资价格及涉农收费的监督检查。</seg></tuv>

</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>依法打击串通涨价、囤积居奇、哄抬物价等违法违规行为。</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Illegal activities such as colluding or hoarding to drive up prices will be punished in accordance with the law. </seg></tuv>

<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>In particular, we need to increase subsidies to poor people and students from poor families to ensure that their basic living standards do not drop because of price increases. </seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>八要遏制生产资料尤其是农业生产资料价格过快上涨。</seg></tuv>

</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>物价问题与人民生活密切相关，各级政府一定要把稳定市场物价放在更加重要的位置。</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>Governments at all levels must give high priority to keeping prices stable because price stability has a direct bearing on the quality of people's lives. </seg></tuv>
</tu>
<tu>
<tuv xml:lang="zh-CN"><seg>现在，国家粮食库存充裕，主要工业消费品供大于求，</seg></tuv>
<tuv xml:lang="en-US"><seg>The country currently has an adequate stock of grain, and the supply of major manufactured consumer goods exceeds demand.</seg></tuv>
